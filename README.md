# Allocation of Paper to Publishing Purposes in Iran
In the interest of transparency, records for allocation of paper to publishing purposes in Iran is available at https://paperds.ir/. I dynamically scrapped the data using this Python web scraper script and built a dashboard to facilitate access to current records. The dashboard is available [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/33440/AllocationofPapertoPublishingPurposesinIran?:language=en&:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link)
